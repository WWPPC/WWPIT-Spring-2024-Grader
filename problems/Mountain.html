Jie is climbing a mountain which is $N$ units tall, as inspiration for his latest game “Mountain Guarder”. 
<br><br>
Fortunately, he has the help of an expert climbing team of robots. He can pay a $X$ dollars for a team of infinite robots with experience level $X$.
<br><br>
Both Jie and all of the robots start at height $0$. In $1$ second, Jie or a robot can move $1$ unit up if there is a robot below or at their height that is at most $X$ units below. Only one climber can move in each second. Note that there must be a robot within $X$ units below before the move is made, not necessarily after.
<br><br>
Find the minimum amount of money Jie needs to pay to climb the mountain in at most $K$ seconds.
<br><br>
<h3>Input</h3>
The first line contains an integer $T$ $(1 \le T \le 2\cdot 10^5)$ the number of testcases
<br>
Each testcase contains two integers $N$ and $K$ $(1 \le N \le K \le 10^9)$.
<h3>Output</h3>
Output $T$ lines, minimum amount of money Jie needs to pay for each testcase.

<h3>Note</h3>
It takes exactly $8$ seconds in testcase 1 with $1$ dollar.
<br>
It takes $19$ seconds in testcase 2 with $4$ dollars.
